# Pattern Question using Loops and Functions

This program contains four functions, each of which produces a different pattern using loops and control structures.

## Part A

This part produces a triangular pattern made up of slashes and exclamation marks. The pattern is created using three while loops, which iterate through the rows and columns of the pattern.

## Part B

This part creates a diamond-shaped pattern made up of asterisks, slashes, and backslashes. The pattern is created using four for loops, which iterate through the rows and columns of the pattern.

## Part C

This part creates a pyramid pattern made up of numbers. The pattern is created using two for loops, which iterate through the rows and columns of the pattern.

## Part D

This part creates a complex pattern made up of slashes, backslashes, asterisks, and other characters. The pattern is created using multiple for loops and print statements, which iterate through the rows and columns of the pattern.

To run this program, simply call each function in the main program or call the functions from another program file. Each function produces a different pattern in the console output.
