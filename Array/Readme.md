README

This code contains a set of C++ functions that perform various mathematical and string operations. The functions are as follows:

1. `add()`: This function takes two parameters and returns their sum.

2. `add()`: This function takes two arrays as parameters and returns a new array that contains the sum of corresponding elements of both arrays.

3. `sub()`: This function takes two parameters and returns their difference.

4. `Div()`: This function takes two parameters and returns their quotient.

5. `prime()`: This function takes a number as a parameter and returns a boolean value that indicates whether the number is prime or not.

6. `Fact()`: This function takes a number as a parameter and returns its factorial.

7. `SQRT()`: This function takes a number as a parameter and returns its square root.

8. `superString()`: This function takes a string as a parameter and returns a boolean value that indicates whether the string is equal to "ZYY" or not.

9. `SplitToSets()`: This function takes an array of integers and a number as parameters. It sorts the array in ascending order and splits it into two sets. If the number is even, the function splits the array into two sets of equal size. If the number is odd, the function splits the array into two sets, with the first set having one more element than the second set. The function returns the absolute difference between the sum of the elements in the first set and the sum of the elements in the second set.

10. `subPalindrome()`: This function takes a string as a parameter and returns its length.

All of these functions are written as templates that can accept any data type. The code also includes the necessary headers and namespace declarations.

Note: The code could be improved by adding comments to explain what each function does and how it works.
