## Q5 Part 1

## Loan Management System

This program is a loan management system written in C++ that allows users to input loan details and calculates the penalty and total charges for the loan. 

## How to use the program

1. Enter the amount of loan you want and the number of installments you require.

2. Enter the details of each installment including the due amount, due date, paid amount, and paid date.

3. The program will calculate the penalty for late payment and display the total balance and charges.

4. The user can choose to continue entering loan details by pressing 'Y' when prompted.

## Program Structure

The program first initializes the necessary variables and then prompts the user to enter the loan amount and the number of installments. 

Next, a loop is started which prompts the user to enter the details of each installment, including the due amount, due date, paid amount, and paid date. The program calculates the penalty for late payment and displays the total balance and charges.

The loop continues until the user chooses to stop by pressing 'N'.

## Limitations

- This program is only designed for a single loan and does not support multiple loans.

- The program does not provide an option to save the loan details to a file or database for future reference.

- The program assumes that the user will input valid and accurate data. 

- The program does not take into account additional fees or taxes that may apply to the loan.
