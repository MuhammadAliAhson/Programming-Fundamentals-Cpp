## Q5 Part 1

## Loan Management System

This program is a loan management system written in C++ that allows users to input loan details and calculates the penalty and total charges for the loan. 

## How to use the program

1. Enter the amount of loan you want and the number of installments you require.

2. Enter the details of each installment including the due amount, due date, paid amount, and paid date.

3. The program will calculate the penalty for late payment and display the total balance and charges.

4. The user can choose to continue entering loan details by pressing 'Y' when prompted.

## Program Structure

The program first initializes the necessary variables and then prompts the user to enter the loan amount and the number of installments. 

Next, a loop is started which prompts the user to enter the details of each installment, including the due amount, due date, paid amount, and paid date. The program calculates the penalty for late payment and displays the total balance and charges.

The loop continues until the user chooses to stop by pressing 'N'.

## Limitations

- This program is only designed for a single loan and does not support multiple loans.

- The program does not provide an option to save the loan details to a file or database for future reference.

- The program assumes that the user will input valid and accurate data. 

- The program does not take into account additional fees or taxes that may apply to the loan.




## Q5 Part 2


Sure, here are the step-by-step instructions for the loan management program:

1. Open your preferred code editor and create a new file.
2. Copy and paste the code from Part 1 and Part 2 into the new file.
3. Save the file with a name of your choice and with the file extension .cpp.
4. Compile and run the program to see the output.
5. When the program runs, it will prompt you to enter the loan amount and the number of installments you want.
6. After entering these values, the program will prompt you to enter the due amount, due date, paid amount, and paid date for each installment.
7. Enter the values as prompted and press Enter after each input.
8. Once you have entered all the installment details, the program will calculate the penalty and display the installment details, penalty, total balance, and charges.
9. The program will then prompt you if you want to continue with another loan, if yes then enter 'Y' else enter anything else to exit the program.

Note: The program is designed to handle only 50 installments. If you need to enter more installments, you will need to modify the program accordingly.
